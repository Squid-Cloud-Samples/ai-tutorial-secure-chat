# Squid Samples: Securing your Squid AI

## This sample app contains client and backend code to demonstrate using Squid AI

As a complete, next-generation middle tier, Squid offers fully integrated and native AI solutions in addition to all the infrastructure and orchestration you need to realize the full potential of your own data.

There are two options for approaching this project:

- The `tutorial-starter` directory contains a project designed to accompany [this step-by-step tutorial](https://docs.squid.cloud/docs/tutorials/squid-facts-2). This option allows you to fill in all the related Squid Cloud code to get a better idea of how the SDK functions.
- The `complete` directory contains the completed project. This option allows you to add only the required configuration and get up and running as quickly as possible.
